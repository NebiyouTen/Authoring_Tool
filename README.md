# Authoring_Tool

### Configuring The Authoring Tool 
Before you run the main program. You might need to edit the *config.py* file, and 
change the parameters for each virtual reality(VR) object. Currently, the program supports only 3 VR objects, 
a picture, a cube and a sphere. Please note that, all the images should be in bmp format. 

```
"out_image_size" : (4096, 4096), 		        # Size of the output of an image in pixels

  "sphere":  
          "name": "VRSphere.bmp,            # Name of the sphere image
          "center": (40, 60),               # Its center in the World coordinates
          "radius": 10, 				            # in units of focal length
          "tait-bryan-angles": [0, 30, 69] 	# in degrees

      "cube": 
          # You have to put the name of all 6 images that form a cube
